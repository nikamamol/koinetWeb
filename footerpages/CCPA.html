                        <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible
                            or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>

                    </ol>
                    <p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request
                        on behalf of your minor child.</p>
                    <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
                        <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request
                        does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
                    <p class="fs-3 fw-bold">Use of Personal Information</p>
                    <p>We may use or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the following business purposes:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To fulfill or meet the reason for which the information is provided. For example, if you provide us with personal information in order for us to deliver a whitepaper or product information, we will use that information to confirm
                            request/consent.
                        </li>
                        <li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us.</li>
                        <li>To provide you with email alerts, event registrations and other notices concerning our products or services, or events or news, that may be of interest to you.</li>
                        <li>To improve our website and present its contents to you.</li>
                        <li>For testing, research, analysis and product development.</li>
                        <li>As necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our clients or others.</li>
                        <li>To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.</li>
                        <li>As described to you when collecting your personal information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA.</li>
                        <li>To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding,
                            in which personal information held by us is among the assets transferred.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.</p>
                    <p class="fs-3 fw-bold">Response Timing and Format</p>
                    <p>We are committed to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response
                        by postal mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot
                        comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another
                        entity without hindrance.</p>
                    <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request.</p>
                    <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
                        <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
                        <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
                        <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="fs-3 fw-bold">Changes to Our Privacy Notice</p>
                    <p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this privacy notice, we will notify you by email or through a notice on our website homepage.</p>
